<p id="text1"> This is our familly tree of the gods worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. There were many gods that they worshipped and this is just a small number of them. There were also many different versions of their myths and the family relations changes between the different versions. This tree only shows the family connections that are the most common and understandable. If you want to view more information on a particular god, click on their image and you will be taken to another page with more information.<br><br>If two gods have a staight line connecting them from their sides and then goes down, those two gods are the parents of the gods connected below. For example, the Sons of Horus are the children of Horus and Serket. There os an exception to this which is that Amun-Ra is not the child of Ra and Amun but is a combination of both of them in one god.</p>

<br><br> <p> If the lines goes down from the two gods and then connects it means that either of the gods could be the parents and that it is impossible to eleminate one for the simplicity of the tree. For example, Ra could be the son of any of Mehet-Weret, Nu, Neith and Khnum. In the case of Ra, he was also sometimes considered to have been self-created.</p>

<br><br> <p> If two gods are connected by a straight horizontal line but that line never connects to any children, it means that the two gods are married or connected in a similar way but either don't have any children or their children aren't displayed on our tree. For example, Set and Nephthys are married but do not have any children (they may have had children but we put them under who were more often considered the parents).</p>

<br><br> <p> If a god has a dotted box around their name, it means that they have appeard higher up on the tree and they are appearing again to show their relationship to someone else. For example, this is Ra's second appearance in the tree and is put there to show the relationship with Isis and Sekhmet</p>
