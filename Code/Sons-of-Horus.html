  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:16px"> Qebehsenuef was one of the four sons of Horus born of Isis and was portrayed as a mummified falcon.  The other three sons of Horus were Imsety,Hapy and Duamutef. They were born from a lotus flower and were solar gods associated with the creation. They were retrieved from the waters of Nun by Sobek on the orders of Re (Ra).  It was believed that Anubis gave the four sons the funerary duties of mummification, the Opening of the Mouth, the burial of Osiris and all men.  Horus later made them protectors of the four cardinal points (north, south, east and west). In the Hall of Ma'at they sat on a lotus flower in front of Osiris. Most commonly, however, they were remembered as the protectors of the internal organs of the deceased. Each son protected an organ, and each son was protected by a goddess.  Qebehsenuef role was to protect the intestines of the deceased and was the guardian of the West. He was protected by the goddess Selket (the goddess of scorpions and magic).  Imsetyâ€™s role was to protect the liver of the deceased and was the guardian of the South. He was protected by the goddess Isis.  Duamutef's role was to protect the stomach of the deceased and was the guardian of the East.  He was protected by the goddess Neith and the last son Hapy.  Hapy's role was to protect the lungs of the deceased and was the guardian of the North. He was protected by the goddess Nephthys. Hapy is sometimes confused with the Nile-god "Hapi".<a href="http://www.egyptianmyths.net/"><sup>1</sup></a>
